/**
 * Spawns tests/adapter/support/parse-staleness-runner.ts in a fresh `node` subprocess with
 * `NODE_ENV=production` pinned (see that file's doc comment for why this must be a subprocess,
 * not an in-process vitest call).
 *
 * `NODE` matters for a completely different, surprising reason from `NODE_ENV`: `pnpm run <script>`
 * (which is how this very test suite gets invoked by `pnpm test`) sets a bare `NODE` env var to
 * the node binary path, and inherits it down through vitest into whatever `execFileSync` spawns
 * from inside a test. `@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin`'s schema cache (esm/cache.js's
 * `ModuleCache.get`) has `if (process.env.NODE || process.hrtime(lastSeen)[0] < settings.lifetime)
 * return result;` -- so when `NODE` is set to any truthy string (regardless of its value), the
 * `10-second lifetime` on the right of `||` is never even evaluated: the cached schema would be
 * returned forever, no matter how much real time passes, WERE IT NOT for the workaround in
 * parse.ts's `parseForESLintDefeatingNodeCacheBypass` (see that function's doc comment), which
 * neutralizes `process.env.NODE` around each synchronous `parseForESLint` call.
 *
 * By default (`nodeEnvValue` omitted) this deletes `NODE` from the spawned env entirely, so a
 * test's outcome reflects only `invalidateIfConfigChanged` (this package's own cache fix),
 * independent of whether the workaround above also happens to be doing its job. Pass
 * `nodeEnvValue` (e.g. the current `process.execPath`, mirroring what pnpm actually sets it to)
 * to force `NODE` to be set for the whole life of the subprocess -- i.e. to simulate a language
 * server launched via `pnpm exec`/`pnpm run` -- and specifically exercise the workaround.
 *
 * `waitMs` is the delay the runner waits, inside its single long-lived process, between editing
 * the schema file and calling `parseDocuments` a second time. Pass 0 to observe the state
 * immediately after the edit; pass something past `@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin`'s own 10-second
 * schema-cache TTL to observe the state once that cache would have expired on its own.
