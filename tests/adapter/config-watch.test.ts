  // `NODE_ENV=test` on itself, so calling `parseDocuments` in-process here would never observe
  // the staleness this test exists to catch. Instead this spawns a genuine `node` subprocess
  // with `NODE_ENV=production` pinned and performs both calls, and the schema edit between them,
  // inside that ONE subprocess -- see support/parse-staleness-runner.ts and
  // support/run-parse-staleness.ts for the mechanics.
  //
  // `@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin` also has a second, independent cache: `esm/cache.js`'s
  // `ModuleCache`, used by `esm/schema.js` to memoize the loaded `GraphQLSchema` for up to 10
  // seconds. That means a schema edit becomes visible to a fresh `parseDocuments` call as soon
  // as invalidateIfConfigChanged clears OUR cache, but the actual graphql-eslint internals
  // underneath can still serve the old schema object for up to 10s after it was first loaded.
  // This test waits 11s past the edit so both caches have had a chance to give way, isolating
  // what this task's own fix controls (see the report for the sub-10s case, which is expected to
  // still be stale, and for why no amount of cache-clearing in this package can shorten that
  // window).
  //
  // This test runs with `NODE` deliberately unset (see run-parse-staleness.ts), which is the
  // "clean" case. See the next test for the `NODE`-set case, which needs
  // parse.ts's `parseForESLintDefeatingNodeCacheBypass` workaround to behave the same way.
